2. GENERAL INFORMATION

    a) Caching

    Qissues heavily relies on caching to keep the interface snappy. Press Ctrl+R to force any 
    stale page to be refreshed.

    b) Filtering and Reports

    As you add and remove filters, they are automatically remembered before closing. You can
    save them to named reports to easily jump between multiple views. After saving a report,
    subsequent changes will only modify the default report -- not the saved one.


3. Creating and Editing Issues

    a) Starting an Issue

    In addition to the standard empty issue template, you can use your currently applied filters
    to prefill or suggest options to you. Taking project as an example: if your filters are only
    showing one project, the issue template will omit that field for you. If there are multiple,
    the suggestions will be reduced to just those selected.

    b) Matching fields

    All meta fields are fuzzy matched. They'll use the first value that satisfies a case-insensitive
    fuzzy search. For instance, 'smith' will match 'john.smithson'.

    c) Cancel Changes

    If you want to cancel creating or editing an issue, you can either save/close the file with no
    changes, or you can empty and then save/close it;
