# Qissues

Qissues is an interactive cli for JIRA and other bug tracking systems. With vim-style keybindings, you can navigate, view and interact with issues quickly from your keyboard.

## Getting Started

Install via npm:

```
npm install -g qissues
```

Run `qissues` to open the app. The first time loading the app will prompt you for the necessary configuration.
